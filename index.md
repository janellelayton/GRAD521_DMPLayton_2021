# Data Description

  Community descriptions are often lacking in remote areas making it difficult to manage for conservation or sustainability of species and it has been demonstrated that species diversity can be important for resiliency of a community. This is a descriptive study on the ichthyoplankton community off of Little and Grand Cayman to provide extremely valuable information that was not previously obtainable and to better understand species diversity of this area. The primary research questions are (1) what species make up the larval fish community of the Cayman Islands; and (2) how does diversity of larval fish communities vary by habitat type, year, Little Cayman vs Grand Cayman, and North vs South Little Cayman?
  Primarily quantitative data has been collected to better understand the larval fish community of the Cayman Islands from 2007-2009. This data is being used to calculate and compare species diversity by habitat type, year, Little Cayman vs Grand Cayman, and North vs South Little Cayman. The three main data sets needed are for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. 
  The first set includes the following: (1) family, genus, and species of fish larvae observed; (2) date collected; (3) trap used to collect the fish; (4) collection location; and (5) the amount of each species collected. All data collected for this set was documented in an Excel file saved as a .xlsx file sized at 282.8 KB. The second set included photographs of identified species from field collections. All photographs were saved as .jpg files sized at approximately 0.5 GB. 
The third set of data includes the Shannon diversity index calculations by (1) each year from pooled data of all sample sites and taxonomic levels; (2) family where data was collected for each sample site and grouped by year, and species where data was collected for each sample site and grouped by year. All data collected for this set will be documented in an Excel file saved as a .xlsx file sized at about 70 KB.

# Roles and responsibilities

  The graduate student will draft the data management plan for the PI to review and revise. The PI will be responsible for the data management plan implementation which means they will confirm the data management plan is being followed throughout the project. Data has already been collected by project volunteers and co-authors during the month of March from 2007-2009. 
  The PI is responsible for access control, managing, archiving and the preservation of the data in the Box folder while the graduate student is responsible for data organization, data analysis, and metadata generation. Project volunteers and co-authors were responsible for instrumentation maintenance and quality control along with data collection that occurred in 2007-2009. In a scenario where volunteers and/or co-authors are lost, their responsibilities will be equally spread among other volunteers, co-authors, and the graduate student. In a scenario where the PI would no longer be able to work with this project, one of the co-authors on the project that qualifies as a later career scientist would take their responsibilities. Lastly in a situation where the graduate student is no longer able to work on the project, it is the responsibility of the PI to find another student willing to take over the responsibilities left by the previous graduate student.
  According to OSUâ€™s definition of sensitive and confidential data, none of the data being collected is considered sensitive and it does not need protected.
The backup strategy for this dataset is quite simple. There are always 3 copies in total of the original dataset. One saved with the PI, one with graduate student, and one on a shared network drive on Box. The Box folder is always backed up on a hard drive stored in the office of the PI. Saving new data to this Box folder and to the hard drive is a manual process. The Box folder is available to the PI, co-authors, and all volunteers so when the graduate student graduates all data will still be accessible.
