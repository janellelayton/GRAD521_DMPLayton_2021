Data Management Plan for the research project, Ichtyoplankton Community on Little and Grand Cayman.

Context of the project:

  Community descriptions are often lacking in remote areas making it difficult to manage for conservation or sustainability of species and it has been demonstrated that species diversity can be important for resiliency of a community. This is a descriptive study on the ichthyoplankton community off of Little and Grand Cayman to provide extremely valuable information that was not previously obtainable and to better understand species diversity of this area. The primary research questions are (1) what species make up the larval fish community of the Cayman Islands; and (2) how does diversity of larval fish communities vary by habitat type, year, Little Cayman vs Grand Cayman, and North vs South Little Cayman?
